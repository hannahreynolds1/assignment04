## Data

This data is from the Health Resources and Services Administration  <https://data.hrsa.gov/tools/shortage-area/hpsa-find>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
